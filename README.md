# BlogApp

Local blog app, that I created as a task when applying for a job. If you want to test it, go ahead!

Clone the repository to your IDE and run:

`npm install`

App is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/client), so when all the dependencies are installed, you can run the application by running this in your terminal:

`expo start`

Test it on your smartphone with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app or in the browser. I made it somewhat responsive.

If you have any suggestions, to what I can add to the app, feel free to tell me. Althoug I did it in around 4 days, I am looking forward to improving it in the future, just as a fun side project.

I have now proceeded with actually finishing the app as a whole. I have created a [custom API](https://github.com/Janzunec/express-API) with Express and am storing data in the SQL database.
