# BlogApp

Local blog app, that I created as a task when applying for a job. If you want to test it, go ahead!

Clone the application to your IDE and run:

`npm install`

When all the dependencies are installed you can run the application by running this in your terminal: 

`expo start`

If you have any suggestions to what I can add to the app, feel free to tell me. Althoug I did it in around 4 days, I am looking forwar into improving it in the future, just as a fun side project.
